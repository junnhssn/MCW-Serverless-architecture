## Exercise 7: Configure continuous deployment for your Function App

**Duration**: 40 minutes

In this exercise, configure your Function App that contains the ProcessImage function for continuous deployment. You will first set up a GitHub source code repository, then set that as the deployment source for the Function App.

### Task 1: Add git repository to your Visual Studio solution and deploy to GitHub

1. Open the **TollBooth** project in Visual Studio.

2. Right-click the **TollBooth** solution in Solution Explorer, then select **Create Git Repository...**.

    ![In Solution Explorer, TollBooth solution is selected. From its right-click context menu, the Create Git Repository item is selected.](media/github-1.png 'Solution Explorer')

3. Click **Sign in...** next to Account under `Create a new GitHub repository`, then select **GitHub account**.

    ![The sign in button is highlighted.](media/github-2.png "Create a Git repository")

4. If the below web page appears, select **Authorize github** to grant Visual Studio additional permissions to work with your GitHub account.

    ![The authorize github button is highlighted.](media/github-3.png "Allow additional permissions")

5. Sign in to your GitHub account. After a few moments, you will see a Success page appear, stating that your authorization was successful. When you see this, go back to Visual Studio.

    ![The success page is displayed.](media/github-4.png "Your authorization was successful")

6. Complete the form with the following information, then click **Create and Push**:

    a. **Repository Name**: Enter `serverless-architecture-lab`, or other unique name.

    b. **Private**: Uncheck this option.

    ![The form is completed as described.](media/github-5.png "Create a Git repository")
    
7. Open **ProcessImage.cs** from the solution explorer and add an empty line after "**using TollBooth.Models;**"
    
    ![The form is completed as described.](media/github-change.png "Create a Git repository")
    
8. Save your changes.

9. Click the Git menu in Visual Studio, then select Commit or Stash....
    
    ![The Git menu is displayed.](media/visualstudio-7.png "Commit or Stash")

10. Enter a commit message, then select **Commit All**.

    ![The form is completed as described.](media/github-change-2.png "Create a Git repository")

11. After committing, select the **Push** button to push your changes to the GitHub repo.

    ![The Push button is highlighted.](media/visualstudio-9.png "Push changes")

    Afterward, you should see a message stating that you successfully pushed your changes to the GitHub repository.

    ![The message is displayed.](media/visualstudio-10.png "Successfully pushed")

12. Refresh your GitHub repository page in your browser. You should see that the project files have been added. Navigate to the **TollBooth** folder of your repo. Notice that the local.settings.json file has not been uploaded. That's because the .gitignore file of the TollBooth project explicitly excludes that file from the repository, making sure you don't accidentally share your application secrets.

### Task 2: Configure your Function App to use your GitHub repository for continuous deployment

1. Open the Azure Function App you created whose name ends with **FunctionApp**, or the name you specified for the Function App containing the ProcessImage function.

2. Select **Deployment Center(Classic)** underneath Deployment in the left-hand menu.

    ![The Platform features tab is displayed, under Code Deployment, Container settings is selected.](media/github-7.1.png 'TollBoothFunctionApp blade')

3. Select **GitHub** in the **Deployment Center** blade. Select **Authorize** and enter your GitHub credentials if prompted. Select **Continue**.

    ![The GitHub tile is selected from a list of repository options.](media/github-7.png 'Deployment Center blade')

4. Select **App Service build service**, then select **Continue**.

    ![Under the Build Provider step, App Service build service tile is selected.](media/github-8.png 'Deployment Center blade')

5. **Choose your organization**.

6. Choose your new repository under **Choose project**. Make sure the **master branch** is selected.

    ![Fields in the Deployment option blade set to the following settings: Choose your organization, obscured; Choose repository, serverless-architecture-lab; Choose branch, master.](media/github-9.png 'Deployment Center blade')

7. Select **Continue**.

8. On the Summary page, select **Finish**.

9. After continuous deployment is configured, all file changes in your deployment source are copied to the function app and a full site deployment is triggered. The site is redeployed when files in the source are updated.

### Task 3: Finish your ExportLicensePlates function code and push changes to GitHub to trigger deployment

1. Navigate to the **TollBooth** project using the Solution Explorer of Visual Studio.

2. From the Visual Studio **View** menu, select **Task List**.

    ![Task List is selected from the Visual Studio View menu.](media/visualstudio-6.png 'Visual Studio View menu')

3. There you will see a list of TODO tasks, where each task represents one line of code that needs to be completed.

4. Open **DatabaseMethods.cs**.

5. The following code represents the completed task in DatabaseMethods.cs:

    ```csharp
        // TODO 5: Retrieve a List of LicensePlateDataDocument objects from the collectionLink where the exported value is false.
        licensePlates = _client.CreateDocumentQuery<LicensePlateDataDocument>(collectionLink,
                new FeedOptions() { EnableCrossPartitionQuery=true,MaxItemCount = 100 })
            .Where(l => l.exported == false)
            .ToList();
        // TODO 6: Remove the line below.
        licensePlates = new List<LicensePlateDataDocument>();
    ```
    ![](media/TODO-5-6.png)

6. Make sure that you deleted the following line under TODO 6: `licensePlates = new List<LicensePlateDataDocument>();`.

7. Save your changes then open **FileMethods.cs**.

8. The following code represents the completed task in DatabaseMethods.cs:

    ```csharp
    // TODO 7: Asyncronously upload the blob from the memory stream.
    await blob.UploadFromStreamAsync(stream);
    ```
    ![](media/TODO-7.png)

9. Save your changes.

10. Click the **Git** menu in Visual Studio, then select **Commit or Stash...**.

    ![The Git menu is displayed.](media/visualstudio-7.png "Commit or Stash")

11. Enter a commit message, then select **Commit All**.

    ![In the Team Explorer - Changes window, "Finished the ExportLicensePlates function" displays in the message box, and the Commit All button is selected.](media/visualstudio-8.png 'Team Explorer - Changes window')

12. After committing, select the **Push** button to push your changes to the GitHub repo.

    ![The Push button is highlighted.](media/visualstudio-9.png "Push changes")

    Afterward, you should see a message stating that you successfully pushed your changes to the GitHub repository.

    ![The message is displayed.](media/visualstudio-10.png "Successfully pushed")

13. Go back to Deployment Center for your Function App in the portal. You should see an entry for the deployment kicked off by this last commit. Check the timestamp on the message to verify that you are looking at the latest one. **Make sure the deployment completes before continuing**.
