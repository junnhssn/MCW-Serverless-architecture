## Exercise 2: Develop and publish the photo processing and data export functions

**Duration**: 45 minutes

Use Visual Studio and its integrated Azure Functions tooling to develop and debug the functions locally, and then publish them to Azure. The starter project solution, TollBooths, contains most of the code needed. You will add in the missing code before deploying to Azure.

### Task 1: Configure application settings

In this task, you will apply application settings using the Microsoft Azure Portal.

1. Using a new tab or instance of your browser navigate to the Azure portal, <http://portal.azure.com>.

2. Open the **ServerlessArchitecture** resource group, and then select the Azure Function App you created whose name ends with **FunctionApp**. This is the one you created using the **.NET Core** runtime stack. If you did not use this naming convention, that's fine. Just be sure to make note of the name so you can distinguish it from the Function App you will be developing using the portal later on.

    ![In the Application Settings section, the previously defined key / value pairs are displayed.](media/application-settings.png 'Application Settings section')

5. Select **Save**.

    ![Screenshot of the Save icon.](media/image36.png 'Save icon')

### Task 2: Create a system-assigned managed identity for your Function App to connect to Key Vault

In order for your Function App to be able to access Key Vault to read the secrets, you must [create a system-assigned managed identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/overview-managed-identity#adding-a-system-assigned-identity) for the Function App, and [create an access policy in Key Vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/key-vault-secure-your-key-vault#key-vault-access-policies) for the application identity.

1. Open the Azure Function App you created whose name ends with **FunctionApp**.

2. Under **Settings** pane select **Identity**.

3. Within the **System assigned** tab, switch **Status** to **On**. Select **Save**.

   ![](media/onoff.jpg)

### Task 3: Add Function App to Key Vault access policy

Perform these steps to create an access policy that enables the "Get" secret permission:

1. Open your Key Vault service.

2. Select **Access policies**.

3. Select **+ Add Access Policy**.

   ![](media/sa8.png)

4. Select the **Select principal** section on the Add access policy form.

    ![In the Add access policy form, the Select principal field is highlighted.](media/key-vault-add-access-policy-select-principal.png "Add access policy")

5. In the Principal blade, search for your TollBoothFunctionApp Function App's service principal. Enter **TollBooth** in the search box and select it, then click on the **Select** button.

   ![](media/sa10.png)

6. Expand the **Secret permissions** and check **Get** under Secret Management Operations.

    ![In the Add access policy form, the Secret Permissions dropdown is expanded with the Get checkbox checked.](media/key-vault-get-secret-policy.png "Add access policy")

7. Select **Add** to add the new access policy.

8. When you are done, you should have an access policy for the Function App's managed identity. Select **Save** to finish the process.

   ![](media/policy.png)

### Task 4: Finish the ProcessImage function

There are a few components within the starter project that must be completed, marked as TODO in the code. The first set of TODO items we will address are in the ProcessImage function, the FindLicensePlateText class that calls the Computer Vision API, and finally the SendToEventGrid.cs class, which is responsible for sending processing results to the Event Grid topic you created earlier.

> **Note:** Do **NOT** update the version of any NuGet package. This solution is built to function with the NuGet package versions currently defined within. Updating these packages to newer versions could cause unexpected results.

1. Navigate to the **TollBooth** project (`C:\ServerlessMCW\MCW-Serverless-architecture-master\hands-on-lab\starter\TollBooth\TollBooth.sln`) using the Solution Explorer of Visual Studio.

2. When we open TollBooth.sln then for first time VS is asking for login, we need to add instruction for that, below are the screenshots

![The Visual Studio Menu displays, Login.](media/visualstudio.png 'Visual Studio Login')

![The Visual Studio Menu displays, Login.](media/visualstudio2.png 'Visual Studio Login')

 * Azure Usename/Email: <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>
 * Azure Password: <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>

![The Visual Studio Menu displays, Login.](media/visualstudio3.png 'Visual Studio Login')

3. From the Visual Studio **View** menu, select **Task List**.

    ![The Visual Studio Menu displays, with View and Task List selected.](media/vs-task-list-link.png 'Visual Studio Menu')

4. There you will see a list of TODO tasks, where each task represents one line of code that needs to be completed.

    ![A list of TODO tasks, including their description, project, file, and line number are displayed.](media/vs-task-list.png 'TODO tasks')

5. Open **ProcessImage.cs**. Notice that the Run method is decorated with the FunctionName attribute, which sets the name of the Azure Function to "ProcessImage". This is triggered by HTTP requests sent to it from the Event Grid service. You tell Event Grid that you want to get these notifications at your function's URL by creating an event subscription, which you will do in a later task, in which you subscribe to blob-created events. The function's trigger watches for new blobs being added to the images container of the storage account that was created in Exercise 1. The data passed to the function from the Event Grid notification includes the URL of the blob. That URL is in turn passed to the input binding to obtain the uploaded image from Blob storage.

6. The following code represents the completed task in ProcessImage.cs:

    ```csharp
    // **TODO 1: Set the licensePlateText value by awaiting a new FindLicensePlateText.GetLicensePlate method.**

    licensePlateText = await new FindLicensePlateText(log, _client).GetLicensePlate(licensePlateImage);
    ```

7. Open **FindLicensePlateText.cs**. This class is responsible for contacting the Computer Vision API to find and extract the license plate text from the photo, using OCR. Notice that this class also shows how you can implement a resilience pattern using [Polly](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly), an open source .NET library that helps you handle transient errors. This is useful for ensuring that you do not overload downstream services, in this case, the Computer Vision API. This will be demonstrated later on when visualizing the Function's scalability.

8. The following code represents the completed task in FindLicensePlateText.cs:

    ```csharp
    // TODO 2: Populate the below two variables with the correct AppSettings properties.
    var uriBase = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("computerVisionApiUrl");
    var apiKey = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("computerVisionApiKey");
    ```

9. Open **SendToEventGrid.cs**. This class is responsible for sending an Event to the Event Grid topic, including the event type and license plate data. Event listeners will use the event type to filter and act on the events they need to process. Make note of the event types defined here (the first parameter passed into the Send method), as they will be used later on when creating new functions in the second Function App you provisioned earlier.

10. The following code represents the completed tasks in `SendToEventGrid.cs`:

    ```csharp
    // TODO 3: Modify send method to include the proper eventType name value for saving plate data.
    await Send("savePlateData", "TollBooth/CustomerService", data);

    // TODO 4: Modify send method to include the proper eventType name value for queuing plate for manual review.
    await Send("queuePlateForManualCheckup", "TollBooth/CustomerService", data);
    ```

    > **Note**: TODOs 5, 6, and 7 will be completed in later steps of the guide.

### Task 5: Publish the Function App from Visual Studio

In this task, you will publish the Function App from the starter project in Visual Studio to the existing Function App you provisioned in Azure.

1. Navigate to the **TollBooth** project using the Solution Explorer of Visual Studio.

2. Right-click the **TollBooth** project and select **Publish** from the context menu.

    ![In Solution Explorer, the TollBooth is selected, and within its context menu, the Publish item is selected.](media/image39.png 'Solution Explorer ')

3. In the Publish window, select **Azure**, then select **Next**.

    ![In the Pick a publish target window, the Azure Functions Consumption Plan is selected in the left pane. In the right pane, the Select Existing radio button is selected and the Run from package file (recommended) checkbox is unchecked. The Create Profile button is also selected.](media/vs-publish-function.png 'Publish window')

    > **Note**: If you do not see the ability to publish to an Azure Function, you may need to update your Visual Studio instance.

4. In the App Service form, select your **Subscription**, select **Resource Group** under **View**, then expand your **ServerlessArchitecture** resource group and select the Function App whose name ends with **FunctionApp**. Finally, **uncheck the `Run from package file` option**.

5. Whatever you named the Function App when you provisioned it is fine. Just make sure it is the same one to which you applied the Application Settings in Task 1 of this exercise.

    ![In the App Service form, Resource Group displays in the View field, and in the tree-view below, the ServerlessArchitecture folder is expanded, and TollBoothFunctionApp is selected.](media/vs-publish-function2.png 'Publish window')

    > **Note**: We do not want to run from a package file, because when we deploy from GitHub later on, the build process will be skipped if the Function App is configured for a zip deployment.

6. After you select the Function App, select **Finish**.

    > **Note**: If prompted to update the functions version on Azure, select **Yes**.

7. Select **Publish** to start the process. Watch the Output window in Visual Studio as the Function App publishes. When it is finished, you should see a message that says, `========== Publish: 1 succeeded, 0 failed, 0 skipped ==========`.

    ![The Publish button is selected.](media/vs-publish-function3.png "Publish")

8. Using a new tab or instance of your browser navigate to the Azure portal, <http://portal.azure.com>.

9. Open the **ServerlessArchitecture** resource group, then select the Azure Function App to which you just published.

10. Select **Functions** in the left-hand menu. You should see both functions you just published from the Visual Studio solution listed.

    ![In the Function Apps blade, in the left tree-view both TollBoothFunctionApp, and Functions (Read Only) are expanded. Beneath Functions (Read Only), two functions ExportLicensePlates and ProcessImage are highlighted.](media/functionappp.png 'TollBoothFunctionApp blade')

11. Now we need to add an Event Grid subscription to the ProcessImage function, so the function is triggered when new images are added to blob storage. Select the **ProcessImage** function, select **Integration** on the left-hand menu, select **Event Grid Trigger (eventGridEvent)**, then select **Create Event Grid subscription**.

    ![In the TollboothFunctionApp tree-view, the ProcessImage function is selected. In the code window pane, the Add Event Grid subscription link is highlighted.](media/processimage-add-eg-sub.png 'ProcessImage function')

12. On the **Create Event Subscription** blade, specify the following configuration options:

    a. **Name**: Unique value for the App name similar to **processimagesub** (ensure the green check mark appears).

    b. **Event Schema**: Select Event Grid Schema.

    c. For **Topic Type**, select **Storage Accounts**.

    d. Select your **subscription** and **ServerlessArchitecture** resource group.

    e. For resource, select your recently created storage account.

    f. Select only the **Blob Created** from the event types dropdown list.

    g. Endpoint Type: Leave Azure Function as the endpoint type.
    
    h. Endpoint: Click on **select endpoint**. 
    
    i. Now **Select Azure Function** window will appear, add following configurations there:
       - Select your subscription from the dropdown.
       - Select you Resource Group **serverless-architecture-DID** from the dropdown.
       - Function App: Select **TollBoothFunctionApp-DID** from the dropdown.
       - Slot: **Production**
       - Function: Select **ProcessImage** from the dropdown.
       
![Azurefunction](media/azurefunction14.jpg 'Azure Function')


Then select **Confirm Selection**.

13. Leave the remaining fields at their default values and select **Create**.

    ![In the Create event subscription form, the fields are set to the previously defined values.](media/processimage-eg-sub.png)
