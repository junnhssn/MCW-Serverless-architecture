# Serverless architecture hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hand-on lab, you will be challenged to implement an end-to-end scenario using a supplied sample that is based on Microsoft Azure Functions, Azure Cosmos DB, Event Grid, and related services. The scenario will include implementing compute, storage, workflows, and monitoring, using various components of Microsoft Azure. The hands-on lab can be implemented on your own, but it is highly recommended to pair up with other members at the lab to model a real-world experience and to allow each member to share their expertise for the overall solution.

At the end of the hands-on-lab, you will have confidence in designing, developing, and monitoring a serverless solution that is resilient, scalable, and cost-effective.

## Overview

Contoso Ltd. is rapidly expanding their toll booth management business to operate in a much larger area. As this is not their primary business, which is online payment services, they are struggling with scaling up to meet the upcoming demand to extract license plate information from a large number of new tollbooths, using photos of vehicles uploaded to cloud storage. Currently, they have a manual process where they send batches of photos to a 3rd-party who manually transcodes the license plates to CSV files that they send back to Contoso to upload to their online processing system. They want to automate this process in a way that is cost effective and scalable. They believe serverless is the best route for them, but do not have the expertise to build the solution.

## Solution architecture

Below is a diagram of the solution architecture you will build in this lab. Please study this carefully, so you understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

The solution begins with vehicle photos being uploaded to an Azure Storage blobs container, as they are captured. An Event Grid subscription is created against the Blob storage create event, calling the photo processing **Azure Function** endpoint (on the side of the diagram), which in turn sends the photo to the **Cognitive Services Computer Vision API OCR** service to extract the license plate data. If processing was successful and the license plate number was returned, the function submits a new Event Grid event, along with the data, to an Event Grid topic with an event type called "savePlateData". However, if the processing was unsuccessful, the function submits an Event Grid event to the topic with an event type called "queuePlateForManualCheckup". Two separate functions are configured to trigger when new events are added to the Event Grid topic, each filtering on a specific event type, both saving the relevant data to the appropriate **Azure Cosmos DB** collection for the outcome, using the Cosmos DB output binding. A **Logic App** that runs on a 15-minute interval executes an Azure Function via its HTTP trigger, which is responsible for obtaining new license plate data from Cosmos DB and exporting it to a new CSV file saved to Blob storage. If no new license plate records are found to export, the Logic App sends an email notification to the Customer Service department via their Office 365 subscription. **Application Insights** is used to monitor all of the Azure Functions in real-time as data is being processed through the serverless architecture. This real-time monitoring allows you to observe dynamic scaling first-hand and configure alerts when certain events take place. **Azure Key Vault** is used to securely store secrets, such as connection strings and access keys. Key Vault is accessed by the Function Apps through an access policy within Key Vault, assigned to each Function App's system-assigned managed identity.
